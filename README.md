# docker-iobroker
Docker image for ioBroker (http://iobroker.net) based on debian:latest (http://hub.docker.com/_/debian/)

This project creates a Docker image for running ioBroker in a Docker container. It is made for and tested on a Synology disk station with DSM 6.0.2 and Docker 1.11.2. But it should also work on other systems running Docker.<br>
Cause the container ist based on debian:latest, it acts nearly like a full virtual machine. That makes it possible to easily add some additional dependies for some ioBroker-Adapters.
